# Census-System

A **secure, privacy-first caste census prototype** built to demonstrate how **technology can support transparent data collection, blockchain-based verification, and AI-driven analytics** for informed and inclusive government policymaking. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

📍 **Live Demo:** https://census-system-git-main-akshatx03xs-projects.vercel.app/ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Identity Verification Flow** (simulated)  
  Simulates OTP verification on mobile number and PAN validation for citizen authentication.

- 📝 **Multi-Step Census Data Form**  
  Collects demographic, socio-economic, and caste information securely from users with confirmation steps.

- 🔗 **Blockchain-Based Hash Recording**  
  Uses mocked blockchain hashes to illustrate tamper-proof logging of submitted records.

- 📊 **Admin Dashboard with AI Analytics**  
  Visualizes caste distribution, state-wise trends, and socio-economic insights using interactive charts.

• Built a secure digital census platform for structured demographic data collection and management.

• Integrated ML-based Aadhaar verification to validate identities and reduce duplicate records.

• Implemented SHA-256 blockchain hashing and analytics dashboards to ensure data integrity and support policy

- 📁 **Features**
✅ Add Supabase backend with persistent storage
✅ Secure real authentication (OTP & ID validation)
✅ Real blockchain integration (Ethereum / Hyperledger)
✅ Server-side analytics & caching

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Mock Backend | Simulated APIs + Static Data |
| Analytics | Chart.js / D3 (frontend visualizations) |
| Blockchain Sim | Mocked transaction hashes for demonstration |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## 🚀 What This Prototype Demonstrates

This repository shows a complete **user journey** from login ➝ verification ➝ data submission ➝ visualization, with:

- Privacy-focused UI flows (simulated only, no real user data)  
- Transparent blockchain hash generation (mocked)  
- AI-style analytics dashboards for policy insights  

It showcases how a census system can be built **securely and transparently** using modern web technologies. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
